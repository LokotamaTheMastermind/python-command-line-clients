# Framework Bootstrapper CLI (Command Line Interface)

![Framework Bootstrapper CLI](https://github.com/LokotamaTheMastermind/python-command-line-clients/workflows/Framework%20Bootstrapper%20CLI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a cli built with python for bootstrapping projects that use frameworks
It is highly efficient and gets the job done decently

## Features

1. Started main project
2. Added beautiful UI/UX interface for the `terminal` `cmd` or `powershell`
3. Uses the following packages for functionality `PyInquirer`, `pyfiglet`, `clint`, `click`
4. Added easy customization of more `frameworks` to be bootstrapped
5. It is well documentation in the code

## Folder Structure

```
.vscode           -> VSCode editor configurations
__init__.py       -> Python package identifier
bootstrapper.py   -> Code heart
install.py        -> Installation script for the project
```

## Contributing

If you wanna `contribute` follow the steps below

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Edit the files according to the comments given
3. Make new branch and commit changes
4. Push code to local `remote` user repository
5. Make a pull request explaining briefly and changes made and why it was done
6. If code passes `CI` test then branch will be `merged` to the `master` branch
7. I will then automatically add you names to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md) file

## Areas needed

1. Better documentation
2. Easier and understandable code
3. More `framework` and `programming languages` presets
4. Better UI/UX look
5. Compilation to standalone executables for `Mac` and `Linux`

## Notice

I commands ran from the script are `OS-friendly` and are currently working and maybe updated when there's a new release.
